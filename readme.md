# Portfolio Optimization
This repository contains files for portfolio optimization using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). These techniques are commonly used in finance to optimize the allocation of assets in a portfolio to achieve desired risk-return trade-offs.

# Techniques
The following techniques are implemented in this repository:

- Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is a statistical technique used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset by transforming the original variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated variables called principal components. In the context of portfolio optimization, PCA can be used to identify the most significant factors driving the risk and return of a portfolio, and to construct optimal portfolios based on these factors.

- Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT): MPT is a mathematical framework developed by Harry Markowitz that seeks to optimize the allocation of assets in a portfolio based on the trade-off between risk and return. MPT uses statistical measures such as expected returns, volatilities, and correlations of assets to construct portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of return.
